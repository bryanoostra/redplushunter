/**
 * Any class that implements the IExplainable interface is in more or less 
 * sense able to explain the decisions it has made.
 * 
 * For instance, a character agent receives perceptions, goes through an internal process,
 * and selects an action. The character agent is then asked: explain(action).
 * The character agent in turn has used its deliberative process to come to the decision,
 * and implements explain by asking the deliberative process to explain the action.
 * The deliberative process knows for which goal he has made a plan to come up with the action,
 * and returns this goal.
