		 * However, there are race conditions where appraisal can occur _before_ these elements are received. Results of such race conditions:
		 * 	- Goals that query very recent context (e.g. an action just chosen) might not be adopted yet
		 *  - If the agent tries to see which beliefs enabled his new goal, he might not be aware of these beliefs yet (episodically speaking)
		 *  - etc.
		 *  
		 *   To avoid these problems, the Character Agent will log the fabula elements immediately and will receive a copy of these from the
		 *   Plot Agent as well. But the Character Agent might in the future treat these different, e.g., annotate them with the fact that it
		 *   is out-of-character knowledge.

		 *   UPDATE: is now moved to EpisodicMemoryCollector
