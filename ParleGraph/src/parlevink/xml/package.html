    This package contains several classes to manipulate XML data. The main classes are 
    <code>XMLTokenizer</code>, which makes it possible to read XML-files and query the tags 
    and element data in a tokenizer-styled access and <code>XMLString</code>, <code>BinaryCharData</code>
    and <code>CharData</code> that provide ways to encapsulate data in an XML-conformant string.
