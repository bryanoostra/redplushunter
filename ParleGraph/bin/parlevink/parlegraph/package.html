<body>
The ParleGraph was developed to provide versatile and easily accessible functionality for building, manipulating, exchanging and visualizing graphs in Java. The base of the package is an API that provides this functionality to Java programmers. On top of this API a few application-like extensions have been made that support interactive graph drawing and manipulation using a graphical interface.

<br>

The classes in this top level package are examples of how to use the parlegraph packages.

For a full documentation see The Parlegraph Documentation: in the data directory of the Parlegraph package, run the parlegraphHelp.jar.
