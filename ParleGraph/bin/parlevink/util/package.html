This package contains a number of generic useful classes and interfaces, among which several 
extensions to the Collections framework and a subclass-finder.
<p>The classes <code>IteratorFilter</code>, <code>IteratorChain</code>, 
<code>IteratorTransform</code> and <code>IteratorTransformFilter</code> provide means to 
combine and modify Iterators in a simple and efficient way.
<p>The classes <code>Buffer</code>, <code>BoundedBuffer</code>, <code>Queue</code> and 
<code>QueueCollection</code> implement a few Collection types that seem to have been forgotten 
in the jave collections framework.
<p>The class <code>RTSI</code> (RunTime Subclass Identification) provides a way to iterate through all 
subclasses of a certain class that are accessible from the current application.
<p>The rest of the classes are a mix of odds and ends that are useful in more 
settings than just the package for which they were developed.
